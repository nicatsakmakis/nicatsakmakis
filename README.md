- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicatsakmakis
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to finally use GitHub
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to organise a conference paper
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything!
- 📫 send me a pull request and I will know you need something from me!
- 🙄 this is an extra line to see if everyone is paying attention
- I am going to practice a pull request and branching and forking so that I know what I am talking about!
